understand:

etchasketch
- Need to be able to move my mouse to draw on the screen
- Assignment states to create a 16 x 16 grid of square divs to draw on (should be done first)

- Needs to look nice lol (CSS)



focus on the square grid first (meaning focus on the basic layout first):

1. create a container <div> in the html to hold the squares
2. create a function and maybe an event listener for a slider which takes a "squareSize" argument and iterates through to add the elements in the row, and then clone the node to create the equivalent amount of columns


Next, need to figure out the grid size:

1. use the grid.min-height and grid.min-width (look these up, I'm not sure what the proper js identifers are), and then set the `square` node (in the js) to be min-width/size (double check this)

2. CHECK THE MATH BY DRAWING THIS OUT ON PEN AND PAPER

3. I'm going to have to play around with flex (CSS) in order to get this to work *sad-face*
